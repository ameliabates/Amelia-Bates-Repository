    <h1>Serial Position Effect Lab</h1>
    <p> The serial position effect is a phenomon in psychiology that 
    refers to the tendency to remember the first and last items in a 
    sequence better than the items in the middle. This is caused by
    two memory biases called the primacy effect and the recency effect. </p>
    <p> The purpose of this lab is to test your memory and see if the 
    serial position effect has occured. You will be presented with one word
    at a time. After the list was completed, you will be asked to recall
    as many words as you can any order. Spelling matters. </p>
